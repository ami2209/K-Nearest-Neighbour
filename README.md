# K-Nearest-Neighbour
k-Nearest Neighbors identifies the k number of observations that are most proximate to the test sample, as defined by some distance metric, e.g. Euclidean. From this set of k-neighbors, majority rule is used to predict the class. If k=3 and the nearest neighbor winesâ€™ qualities are {low, low, medium}, then we would classify the test sample as a low-quality wine. The same approach is extended to subsequent test samples.
